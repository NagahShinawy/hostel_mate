# Person Management Application

This is a Django and React-based application that allows users to manage person records. Users can create, read, update, and delete person records through a RESTful API and a React frontend.

## Features

- **Backend (Django)**:
  - RESTful API for CRUD operations on `Person` records.
  - Filter persons by name using a query parameter.
  - Django Admin interface for managing `Person` records.
  - Custom manager for filtering persons by name.

- **Frontend (React)**:
  - Input fields for adding or editing person records.
  - Filter functionality to search for persons by name.
  - Table to display all person records.
  - Buttons for adding, updating, and deleting records.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Django
  - Django REST Framework (DRF)
  - SQLite (default database)

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Axios (for API requests)

- **Testing**:
  - Requests library (for API testing)
  - Faker (for generating dummy data)

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js (for the React frontend)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/person-management-app.git
   cd person-management-app
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/base.txt
   ```

4. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create a superuser** (to access Django Admin):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the Django development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The backend API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend  # Assuming your React app is in a folder named `frontend`
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the React development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.

### Testing the API

1. **Install testing dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements/test.txt
   ```

2. **Run the API testing script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_api.py
   ```
